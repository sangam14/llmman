//! End-to-end tests for `llmman launch <integration> --model qwen3.5:0.8b`.
//!
//! These exercise the real launch path: a real, auto-started `llmman
//! serve`, a real pulled model (`docker.io/ai/qwen3.5:0.8b`, resolved
//! from the bare short name the same way `llmman launch`/`pull` always
//! resolve one — see `shortnames::resolve_ollama_api`), a real
//! `llama-server` backing it, and the real third-party CLI under test
//! (`claude`, `agy`, `opencode`, `codex`, `qwen`, `hermes`, `openclaw`, `dsh`) — not mocks.
//! That's the only way this actually verifies anything: every one of the
//! three bugs this file's tests were written to catch (see below) only
//! ever showed up against the real binaries, never in isolation.
//!
//! Each test prints a message and skips (rather than failing) when a
//! prerequisite isn't installed in the current environment, since none of
//! that is under this crate's control:
//!
//!   - `llama-server` on PATH — required by every one of these (llmman's
//!     daemon can't serve any model without it).
//!   - the specific integration binary under test on PATH.
//!
//! Network access to pull `docker.io/ai/qwen3.5:0.8b` (~740MB, on the
//! first run only — later runs reuse whatever's already in the daemon's
//! store) is assumed available and NOT treated as skippable: a pull
//! failure is a real failure here, not an environment-setup gap.
//!
//! [`serve_mlx_safetensors_model`], [`serve_vllm_safetensors_model`] and
//! [`serve_sglang_safetensors_model`] are the tests in this file that
//! aren't about a third-party integration at all: they exercise `llmman
//! serve`'s own safetensors backends — `mlx_lm.server` (see
//! `cmd::serve::backend::use_mlx_for_safetensors`), `vllm` and `sglang`
//! (`LLMMAN_SAFETENSORS_ENGINE`) — directly via `llmman run`, against a
//! real safetensors model. Like every other test here they skip
//! themselves — rather than failing — when their own prerequisite (the
//! engine on `PATH`; for mlx, Apple Silicon macOS too) isn't met. The
//! vllm and sglang ones run a daemon of their own on a fresh port (the
//! engine choice is daemon-wide environment) — see
//! `serve_safetensors_with_engine`.
//!
//! `llmman serve` is a process-wide singleton bound to a single loopback
//! port (127.0.0.1:17434 by default, or wherever `LLMMAN_HOST` points —
//! see `daemon::server`/`daemon::bind_addr`), so these tests can't
//! isolate their own daemon instance from each other or from one already
//! running on the machine: `llmman launch` (via `daemon::ensure_server`)
//! just reuses whatever's already listening there, preloaded with
//! whichever model first asked for it. What each test *does* isolate is
//! `HOME` (and so each integration's own config directory), by pointing
//! its child process at a fresh temp directory. `SERIAL` below keeps
//! these tests from running concurrently regardless, both to avoid
//! racing to spawn that one shared daemon and to keep real model
//! launches from competing for the same GPU/CPU at once.
//!
//! Not run as part of `cargo build`, and not run by the `test` job in
//! `.github/workflows/ci.yml` (that job only runs the in-crate
//! `#[cfg(test)]` unit tests) — this file is its own separate `e2e` job
//! there instead. To run it locally, invoke it explicitly:
//!
//!   cargo test --release --test launch_e2e -- --nocapture --test-threads=1
//!
//! # Regressions this file guards against
//!
//! All three were found by actually running these exact commands against
//! a real model, not by inspection:
//!
//!   - `claude`: real Claude Code sessions inject a second `role:"system"`
//!     message later in the conversation (e.g. an available-agents/skills
//!     reminder) in addition to its leading system prompt. Qwen3.5's chat
//!     template raises a hard Jinja error ("System message must be at the
//!     beginning") the moment that happens, so every real multi-turn
//!     request 500'd and Claude Code retried in a loop until giving up —
//!     fixed in `cmd::serve::handle_anthropic_messages` by folding every
//!     system-role turn into one leading message.
//!   - `codex`: the config `write_codex_config` wrote (a `[profiles.llmman]`
//!     table in `config.toml`) is a format current codex (0.134+) refuses
//!     to load at all — fixed by writing the sibling
//!     `~/.codex/llmman.config.toml` overlay codex now expects instead.
//!   - `codex`: real `codex exec` always includes Responses-API tool
//!     entries llama-server's `/v1/responses` rejects outright
//!     (`"'type' of tool must be 'function'"` for a `"namespace"`-typed
//!     sub-agent tool bundle, and for the bare `{"type":"web_search"}`
//!     entry) — fixed in `cmd::serve::filter_non_function_tools`. Real
//!     `codex exec` also always carries a `developer`-role item alongside
//!     its top-level `instructions`, which llama-server's own Responses
//!     conversion turns into a second, misplaced `system`-role chat
//!     message (a confirmed, unresolved upstream llama.cpp gap — see
//!     ggml-org/llama.cpp#20733/#23423) — fixed in
//!     `cmd::serve::consolidate_responses_instructions`.
