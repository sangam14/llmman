/// `llmman transfer` transfers an image directly from one location to

///
/// The motivating case is HuggingFace → OCI registry —
/// `llmman transfer hf.co/owner/model registry.example.com/owner/model` —
/// but any source `llmman pull` understands (an OCI registry, `hf://`,
/// `ms://`, ...) can be paired with any OCI registry destination.
///
/// Streaming a blob straight through needs its digest up front. An OCI
/// source gets that from the source manifest, so the transfer stays in
/// the Go shim where the registry protocol lives; HuggingFace needs a
/// HEAD per file first, which `crate::hf::transfer` does natively (for
/// `hf-xet`, which is Rust-only). The remaining sources can't stream at
/// all and stage through a throwaway layout — `crate::sources::transfer`.
///
/// This intentionally talks to the Go shim directly (like `login`/`logout`
/// and `inspect --remote`) rather than through a running `llmman serve`
/// daemon (like `pull`/`push`): a transfer never touches the daemon's
/// persistent store, so there's no shared state to coordinate.
///
/// A transfer is both a pull and a push, so it touches trust twice: an
/// OCI source gets the policy a `pull` would apply (skipping it would
/// launder an unverified model past that policy), and the destination is
/// signed over the digest the transfer reports pushing. HuggingFace and
/// object-store sources have no signature to check, which is why
/// `--sign-key` exists here — a transfer into a registry is where an
/// unsigned upstream becomes something you vouch for.
