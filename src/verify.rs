//! Signature trust policy: which references must be signed, and by whom.
//!
//! The cryptography lives in the Go shim (go-shim/sigstore.go, reached
//! through [`crate::oci::verify`]); this module decides *when* to invoke
//! it and *what a negative answer means*, which is a policy question.
//!
//! Policy comes from the `[verify]` section of `llmman.conf` (see
//! [`crate::config`] for the locations), merged with later files
//! winning:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [verify]
//! default = "off"                  # for references no rule matches
//!
//! [[verify.trust]]
//! pattern = "docker.io/myorg/**"
//! keys    = ["keys/myorg.pub"]     # relative to this file's directory
//! mode    = "enforce"              # off | warn | enforce
//! ```
//!
//! The default is `off`, not `warn`, on purpose: with no configured trust
//! roots there is nothing any model could be checked against, so `warn`
//! would print an unsigned-model warning on every pull that the user can
//! do nothing about — a reliable way to teach people to ignore the one
//! warning that eventually matters.
//!
//! `LLMMAN_VERIFY=off|warn|enforce` overrides the mode (not the keys) for
//! every reference, which is the useful knob in CI.
